# cryptosystem-RSA
RSA with fast arithmetic.

Arithmetic folder contains multiplication (realisation with fft and ifft) with tests.
In prime folder you can see searching of pseudo-random numbers (XorShift and Python random) with tests too.

If you want to use whole cryptosystem run main.py and enter number of key bits 
(key will generate with length of bits that you entered)

If you want to use only part of code for example multiplication download only the folder nultiplication
